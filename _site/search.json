    "text": "Thesis: Domain.com.au and realestate.com.au run a collusive oligopoly for online real estate listings, with Domain charging anywhere between $700 to $7,000 for a listing depending on marketing package tiers and property postcode. However, real estate agencies with smaller online market shares also exist. The online listings of these lower profile agencies are often of greater interest to prospective buyers or renters being often both: (i) cheaper (due to lower marketing costs), and; (ii) less competitive (due to less app/browser traffic).\nReport date: 2023-10-16"
